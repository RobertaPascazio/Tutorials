Forcefield Optimization
=======================
The goal here is to fit a classical potential energy surface (PES) to an
*ab-initio* PES by optimizing the classical forcefield parameters.
This forcefield optimization is conducted using the Addaptive Rate Monte
Carlo method described by S. Cosseddu *et al* in
*J. Chem. Theory Comput.*, **2017**, *13*, 297â€“308.
